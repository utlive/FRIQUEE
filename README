========================================================================

This is a demonstration of a new Feature Maps Driven No-Reference Image Quality Evaluator Engine (FRIQUEE)
The algorithm is described in detail in :

D. Ghadiyaram and A. C. Bovik, "Perceptual Quality Prediction on Authentically Distorted Images Using a
Bag of Features Approach," http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04757 (under review)


You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please
refer to its original source cite our paper as given below:

D. Ghadiyaram and A. C. Bovik, "Perceptual Quality Prediction on Authentically Distorted Images Using a
Bag of Features Approach," http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04757 (under review)

========================================================================

Running on Matlab 


Input : A test image loaded in a 3 dimensional array

Output: 

a) A set of 560 image quality features (FRIQUEE-ALL features, as described in the paper)

b) A quality score of the image. The score typically has a value 
between 0 and 100 (0 represents the worst quality, 100 the best).
  
Usage: Please see example.m for details on how to use this script

Dependencies: 

We are also making a trained model publicly available. This model is trained on all the 1162 test images of the LIVE-Challenge Database using a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) with a radial basis function. The parameters used for training arE:
C (cost) = 2^8;  gamma = 2^-6;

Binaries: - Two mex files svmpredict and svmtrain are also provided with the release. These are compiled on a UNIX environment. If you are on a different OS, please download LIBSVM and compile the files appropriately.

========================================================================

Note on training: 
This release version of FRIQUEE was trained on the entire LIVE database.


This program uses LibSVM binaries.
Below is the requried copyright notice for the binaries distributed with this release.

====================================================================
LibSVM tools: svmpredict, svmtrain (binaries)
